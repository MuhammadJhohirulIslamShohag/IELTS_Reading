**Something I Can’t Live Without – My Electric Kettle**

In my entire life, I have bought many electronic devices, but I would like to talk about a device that is important for my family and me: my electric kettle.

* **What it is:** My electric kettle.
* **Where it came from:** It was a gift from my mother.
* **Why it's important:** It's convenient, saves time, and has cultural significance.

To begin with, it was a gift from my mother. She gave it to me when I moved to a new city for studies. It is a sleek, stainless-steel kettle with automatic shut-off. This gift symbolizes her care for my daily comfort.

In addition to this, I would like to buy a similar kettle for my best friend. She loves tea but struggles with boiling water on the stove. A high-quality electric kettle would save her time and energy. It’s a practical yet thoughtful gift for her busy lifestyle.

Most importantly, the electric kettle is like a "traditional product" in my country. In my culture, serving hot drinks (tea/coffee) to guests is a sign of hospitality. Unlike slow traditional methods, the kettle provides instant boiling water. It bridges modern convenience with cultural warmth.

Moreover, receiving this kettle surprised and made me happy. Firstly, I didn’t expect such a useful gift—it solved my daily struggles. What is more, it reminded me of home whenever I used it. Another important point is that it’s energy-efficient, reducing electricity bills. Last but not least, it became a bonding tool—my roommates and I shared tea breaks.

That’s all I can share at this moment.

**Describe a traditional product in your country – Hilsa Fish**

I want to talk about Hilsa fish. It's a popular and tasty fish in my country.

* **What it is:** Hilsa fish.
* **When I tried it:** When I was little, at a family dinner.
* **What it is:** A natural fish, cooked with spices.
* **Why it's important:** It's a big part of our food and culture.

First, Hilsa is a main food in our cooking. It tastes sweet and rich. It reminds me of happy family times.

Also, I'd like to share Hilsa with my friends who like seafood. It's a part of my culture.

Hilsa is a traditional food in my country. It's more than just food. It's a symbol of our culture, especially during festivals.

I was surprised and happy when I really understood how good Hilsa is. I knew it from childhood, but did not understand the value. It made me feel connected to my home. There are many ways to cook it, so it's always new. We eat Hilsa at family gatherings, and it brings us together.
